# LiveSPICE-MK-Circuits
Schematic files drawn for use with [LiveSPICE]( https://github.com/dsharlet/LiveSPICE ), developed by Dillon ([@dsharlet]( https://github.com/dsharlet ).)

## IMPORTANT!
Some of the models may be "preamp only" sections available due to the following reasons:
 - The referenced schematic does not include the diagram for the power amp section. 
 - The tube stages use the phase inverter of the power amp to cascade more gain.
 - The power amp section is solid state-based.
If any of these are the case, please refer to the schematic file for further details and instructions.
